# TravellingSalesman

In this project, we solve the legendary *Travelling Salesman* problem using genetic algorithm. We don't spend time on the basics, just the cool stuff!

I strongly recommend looking at a YouTube video on Travelling Salesman and Genetic Algorithm if you are not familiar with them.

## The cool stuff
* Object-oriented approach.
* Using Python features like **set()** to improve time complexity.
* Everything from scratch, even an implementation of the infamous Heap's Algorithm.
* Brute force implementation, to check our answer.
* Pre-computation of distances, and some tricks to minimise work done.
* Implementing custom **\_\_str()\_\_** methods, for sensible printing.
* A clever approach to genetic crossover and random mutation.
* Implementation of the intuitive *Roulette Wheel Sampling* method, utilising binary search.
* Visualisation of results.
